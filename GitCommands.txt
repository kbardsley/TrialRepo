Basic git commands:
git status #checks current status of repository (are things up to date?)
git add -A #adds altered and untracked files to staging area
git commit -am 'message' #a = take all files in staging area and make commit with them
							#m = message 'active present tense verb'
							#ex: git commit -am 'modify and add gitignore'
							#commit changes with message
git push #takes changes made locally and new commit and push back up to github repository
			#push commited changes up to GitHub
git pull #pull any changes from GitHub down to local repo
		#often good to start with this

git log #tells gives you commit history
git log --oneline #has each commit take up one line in output
git log -3 #gives the last 3 commits
git log -3 --oneline #does both
git log -1 -p HEAD  #shows the changes that were made for most recent commit
