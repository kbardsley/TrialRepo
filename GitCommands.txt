git add -A #adds altered and untracked files to staging area
git commit -am 'message' #a = take all files in staging area and make commit with them
							#m = message 'active present tense verb'
							#ex: git commit -am 'modify and add gitignore'
							#commit changes with message
git push #takes changes made locally and new commit and push back up to github repository
			#push commited changes up to GitHub
git pull #pull any changes from GitHub down to local repo
		#often good to start with this
